# KMA-Rabbit
2D Platformer featuring a rabbit

Platformer with classic moving platforms, mario-style jump and collectable coins and fruits. 
And, somehow, orcs - that's free art assets for you!

Made for my university unity3d course.
The focus of this project was to minimize the unity editor scripting by doing as much as possible in plain C#.
I also worked on making code more SOLID and testable, and set up testing of unity-engine-bound code using Unity Test Tools
